# PyQuickApache
PyQuickApache is a flask based python application for quickly hosting html files on the web.
If you don't want to use ngrok and you know how to port forward, here you go.

# **IMPORTANT**
Make sure all assets are in the "static" folder, or html files won't be able to access local images/assets.
